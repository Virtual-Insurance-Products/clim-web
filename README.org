#+TITLE: clim-web.asd

* Introduction
This builds on [[https://github.com/Virtual-Insurance-Products/vip-clim-core][vip-clim-core.asd]] to allow building of web applications
with a CLIM-like framework.

The repository
https://github.com/Virtual-Insurance-Products/clim-web-demo
demonstrates the use of this system and /also/ includes static
resources which are needed for it to work. I should probably move
those resources into here.
