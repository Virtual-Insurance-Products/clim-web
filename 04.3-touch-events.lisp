;; handlers for touch events. Make CLIM command easy to trigger on iPads, iPhone etc...

;; TBC...


;; efficient CSS animations operating only on the transform and/or
;; opacity of HTML elements could be used to make very engaging touch
;; UIs if done well. Things like 'throwing' of elemenets would work
;; well. Certainly just getting elements to move with touches would be
;; a good start. Multi touch command selection etc...

;; It would be fun to do this sort of thing. To investigate means of executing commands. We could define gestures to trigger commands (eg 'throw' or 'pinch-zoom') and then automatically generate the code to include those.

;; other gestures might include 'push-together' to push 2 things together
